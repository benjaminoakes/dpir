## Chapter 3: Template Methods

* One thing I find tricky about the Template Method pattern is picking
  methods to "punch out" of the template, in a way that makes
  sense. If you pick strictly the things that vary, it's an effective
  solution, but it might not be the clearest; and as the code ages &
  changes, you might need to refactor the lines of the template
  methods. Maybe this is an argument for keeping use of the template
  method small. I'll try to think up a good example. _Dan_
